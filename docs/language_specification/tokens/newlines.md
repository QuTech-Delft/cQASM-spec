cQASM is newline-sensitive, _i.e._ a newline terminates a statement.

A semicolon `;` may be used instead of a newline to separate statements,
for instance when putting multiple statements on the same line.
Semicolons can also be put at the end of the line for clarity without changing the semantics of the program.
