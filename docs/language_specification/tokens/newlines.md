cQASM is newline-sensitive, _i.e._ a newline terminates a statement.</br>
A semicolon `;` may be used instead of a newline to separate statements,
for instance when putting multiple statements on the same line.</br>
Semicolons can also be put at the end of the line for clarity without changing the semantics of the program.
