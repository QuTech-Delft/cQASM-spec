Keywords constitute identifiers reserved by the language parser. 
As such, they have a specific predefined meaning and cannot be overwritten or used as a general identifier,
_e.g._, as the name of the (qu)bit register.

The table below lists the reserved keywords in cQASM:

| Keyword        | Use                 |
|:---------------|:--------------------|
| __`version`__  | Version statement   |
| __`qubit`__    | Qubit type          |
| __`bit`__      | Bit type            |
| __`measure`__  | Measure instruction |
