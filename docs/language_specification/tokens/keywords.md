Keywords constitute identifiers reserved by the language parser. 
As such, they have a specific predefined meaning and cannot be overwritten or used as a general identifier,
_e.g._, as the name of the (qu)bit register.

The table below lists the reserved keywords in cQASM:

| Keyword                  | Use                     |
|:-------------------------|:------------------------|
| <code>__version__</code> | Version statement       |
| <code>__qubit__</code>   | Qubit type              |
| <code>__bit__</code>     | Bit type                |
| <code>__measure__</code> | Measurement instruction |
