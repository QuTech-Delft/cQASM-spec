Keywords constitute identifiers reserved by the language parser. 
As such, they have a specific predefined meaning and cannot be overwritten or used as a general identifier,
_e.g._, as the name of the (qu)bit register.

The table below lists the reserved keywords in cQASM:

| Keyword       | Use                   |
|:--------------|:----------------------|
| __`version`__ | Version statement     |
| __`qubit`__   | Qubit type            |
| __`bit`__     | Bit type              |
| __`measure`__ | Measure instruction   |    
| __`reset`__   | Reset instruction     |    
| __`ctrl`__    | Control gate modifier |    
| __`inv`__     | Inverse gate modifier |    
| __`pow`__     | Power gate modifier   |
