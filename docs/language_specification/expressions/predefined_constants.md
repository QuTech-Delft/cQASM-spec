The following mathematical constants are recognized:
`pi`, `tau`, and `eu`, where `tau` is $2\pi$ and `eu` represents Euler's constant $e$.
They are stored as floating-point [number literals](../tokens/literals.md) and can be used in [arithmetic expressions](../tokens/operators_and_punctuators),
_e.g._, `pi/2` equals $\tfrac{\pi}{2}$. 

The latter can be used, _e.g._, as an argument for a [parameterized gate](../instructions/gates.md), _i.e._ `Rx(pi/2) q[0]`.
