An instruction statement consist of an instruction and the qubit arguments on which the instruction acts.

The following kinds of instruction exist:

- [Gates](../instructions/gates.md)
- [Measure](../instructions/measure.md)

In the case of the measurement instruction statement, the measurement outcome is directly assigned to a bit.
