This document describes the language specification of the cQASM quantum programming language, version 3.0-beta1.
cQASM stands for common Quantum ASseMbly language.
cQASM 3.0-beta1 supersedes the [cQASM 1.[012] languages](https://libqasm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [cQASM 2.0 language specification](https://github.com/QuTech-Delft/cQASM-spec/tree/2.0-draft-2), the latter of which remains incomplete.

!!! note

    Even though, cQASM 3.0-beta1 is conceptually similar to previous language specifications, it is not a straightforward extension thereof; the syntax and grammar of cQASM 3.0-beta1 differ fundamentally from its predecessors.

In the rest of the documentation we will drop the version label of language and simply refer to it as the cQASM language.

The update of cQASM was motivated by, and developed within the context of, the overhaul of Quantum Inspire.
