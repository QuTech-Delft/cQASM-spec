The following mathematical constants are recognized: `pi`, `tau`, and `eu`, where `tau` is $2\pi$ and `eu` represents Euler's constant $e$.
They are double precision and can be used in arithmetic expressions, _e.g._, `pi/2`. 
The latter can be used, _e.g._, as an argument for a parameterized gate, _i.e._ `Rx(pi/2) q[0]`.
